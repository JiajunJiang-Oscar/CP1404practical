# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Sometimes, I think my estimate is lower than my expectation, but most times is same with or higher 
than my expectation.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

In this semester, I always remind me to add the docstring or comment to explain the code, it makes
my estimate score higher than last semester.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

By doing these estimates, I learn more code with Python and know how to write an interface(Kivy).

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

By other people's comment, I learned how to reduce the duplicated check.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

By review other people's code, I realize I still have to improve my code.
For example: duplicated check, variable name.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
practices.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Explanation

In this review, I spend a few times to check each line for he's code, then I give some 
suggest to improve his code.

### Good Code Review 2

(https://github.com/amritakhatri/1404_practicals/pull/3#pullrequestreview-2411275234)

### Explanation

In this review, I try to help him to improved code format.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I won't change anything because I think now's practical tasks is good enough.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

To be honest, I think there are so many things I need to improve, so I don't think I'm doing anything really well.
