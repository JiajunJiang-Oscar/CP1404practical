Clean Code Key
 - Reduce the duplicate code: Don't do same work in lots of functions or duplicate check
 - Split code area: Insert empty lines between code as appropriate (e.g. between other code and wile/for loop)
 - Follow SRP: Follow the "Single Responsibility Principle" which means only one thing to do in one function
 - Use meaningful variable names: Variable names should clearly express their purpose
